File descriptions

findProteinsWithChanges.ipynb - Python script that extracts protein coding sequences to modify from the published LC300 genome. 
genetic_changes.csv - List of coding genetic changes found during resequencing of the LC300 genome.
Protein alignments - Pairwise alignment output for original and modified protein sequences resulting from the identified coding modifications. Produced using EMBOSS Needle.
sequences_to_modify.txt - Output from the findProteinsWithChanges.ipynb script with sequences that should be updated.
Updated coding sequences - Fasta files for each of the affected genes, containing the original coding DNA sequence and the modified sequence based on the resequencing.
